/**
 * File watcher and infrastructure to support dynamically
 * updating configurations.
 *
 * <p>There are three core components of this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The {@link org.spongepowered.configurate.reference.WatchServiceListener} provides a
 *     reactive interface to listen to filesystem changes</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.spongepowered.configurate.reference.ConfigurationReference ConfigurationReferences}
 *     can either be manually updated, or attached to a watch service, and hold
 *     a loader plus a loaded node, to pass around a reference to a root node
 *     while allowing for reloads.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.spongepowered.configurate.reference.ValueReference Value references}
 *     can be retrieved from configuration references, and provide an always
 *     up-to-date reference to a deserialized value within a
 *     configuration node</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These components are designed to work together, but the watch listener can
 * be used independently from the other components for any situation where file
 * watching is necessary.
